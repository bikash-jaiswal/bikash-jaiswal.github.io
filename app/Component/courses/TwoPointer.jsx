            <div>The Two Pointers pattern is a technique commonly used in computer programming and algorithms. It involves maintaining two pointers (indexes or references) that traverse a data structure, typically an array or a linked list, to solve a problem more efficiently. The two pointers move towards each other, converging or diverging based on the problem requirements.
            </div>
            <div className='p-2'>There are two main variations of the Two Pointers pattern:</div>
            <ol className='list-disc ml-6'>
                <li>Two Pointers Approach:
                    <ol className='list-disc ml-6'>
                        <li> <b>Usage:</b> To efficiently solve problems with linear data structures like arrays or linked lists.</li>
                        <li><b>How it works: </b>Use two pointers, one starting from the beginning and the other from the end, or both starting from the same end but moving at different rates. </li>
                        <li><b>Example: </b>Finding a pair of elements in a sorted array that sum up to a target value. </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Fast and Slow Pointers:
                    <ol className='list-disc ml-6'>
                        <li> <b>Usage:</b> For problems involving linked lists or arrays where you need to find a specific position or cycle.</li>
                        <li><b>How it works: </b>Use two pointers, one moving faster than the other. The faster pointer might move by two or more steps at a time.</li>
                        <li><b>Example: </b>Detecting a cycle in a linked list.</li>
                    </ol>
