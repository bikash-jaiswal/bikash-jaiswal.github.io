# What is Data Structure?
In interviews, proficiency in data structures is crucial for software engineering roles. Candidates are often tested on their understanding and application of fundamental structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs. The ability to choose and implement the appropriate data structure efficiently is essential for solving algorithmic problems and optimizing code. A solid grasp of these concepts not only showcases a candidate's technical expertise but also demonstrates their problem-solving skills in various scenarios.

# What are different categories on Data Structure
![Type of Data Structure](/images/categories-of-ds.png)

### Primitive Data Types
Basic data types like integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.

### Linear Data Structures
1. **Arrays:** Contiguous memory storage for elements.
2. **Linked Lists:** Elements linked through pointers.
3. **Stacks:** Last In, First Out (LIFO) structures.
4. **Queues:** First In, First Out (FIFO) structures.
5. **Heaps:** Specialized trees used in priority queue implementations.
6. **Hash Tables:** Key-value pairs with a hash function for efficient data retrieval.

### Non-linear Data Structures
7. **Trees:** Hierarchical structures with nodes connected by edges.
8. **Graphs:** Collections of nodes connected by edges; can be directed or undirected.
9. **Trie:** Tree-like structure for efficient retrieval of key-value data.

Understanding these categories and their implementations is crucial for effective problem-solving in coding interviews and real-world software development.

# Time and Space Complexity

## Time Complexity

**Time complexity** is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. It's expressed using big O notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm's running time.

### Examples in Python

1. **Constant Time (O(1)):**
    ```python
    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    print(my_list[0])  # O(1)
    ```

2. **Linear Time (O(n)):**
    ```python
    def linear_search(my_list, target):
        for item in my_list:
            if item == target:
                return True
        return False
    ```

3. **Quadratic Time (O(n^2)):**
    ```python
    def bubble_sort(my_list):
        n = len(my_list)
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
                if my_list[j] > my_list[j + 1]:
                    my_list[j], my_list[j + 1] = my_list[j + 1], my_list[j]
    ```

## Space Complexity

**Space complexity** is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the size of the input. It's expressed using big O notation.

### Examples in Python

1. **Constant Space (O(1)):**
    ```python
    def constant_space_example():
        a = 5
        b = 10
        result = a + b
    ```

2. **Linear Space (O(n)):**
    ```python
    def linear_space_example(n):
        my_list = [0] * n
        for i in range(n):
            my_list[i] = i
    ```

3. **Quadratic Space (O(n^2)):**
    ```python
    def quadratic_space_example(n):
        matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    ```

Understanding time and space complexity helps in analyzing and optimizing algorithms to ensure efficiency for different input sizes.
